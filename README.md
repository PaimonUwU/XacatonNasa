Platanario is an arcade game inspired by the aligment mechanics of the JWST, in this game you control the pet of C-Zar who has fallen sleep while controlling the telescope after a long day of work, you must avoid obstacles and enemies to obtain perfect image transmisions. As you progress the image gets clearer and if you finish the sequence without taking too many hits, you will be rewarded with one of the JWST images.
